# Core Sass Framework
A mobile first Sass framework which forms the basis for all of my projects from 
now on.

It's currently in it's infancy but will be expanded over time.

Who knows, I might even come up with a wacky name for it when it's ready!

At present there is only rules for the grid and typography, but I will shortly 
be adding tables and other HTML components.

## Usage

Clone the repository or download the zip file. You'll need to [install Compass]
(http://compass-style.org/install/) before getting started. Once installed,
run `compass compile` to update the CSS or `compass watch` to rebuild the
CSS as the Sass is updated.

Typography rules have been created using a base font-size of 18 pixels, a base
line height of 1.5 and a scale ratio of 1.618 (the golden ratio). These are the 
only three values you need to update in order to alter the typography.

A single `index.html` file is supplied with sample typography.
