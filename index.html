                <p>Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are
                    correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per
                    hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this,
                    watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles
                    per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly
                    1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. The way I see it, if you're
                    gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it
                    with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction
                    made the flux dispersal- look out. What? What did I
                    just say? Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must
                    prepare to reload.</p>
                <h3 class="heading">Heading Three</h3>
                <p>Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera,
                    could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way
                    to the mall? Huh? One point twenty-one gigawatts. One
                    point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Quiet. Roads?
                    Where we're going we don't need roads.
                </p>
                <p>Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? Quiet. Marty, that's
                    completely out of the question, you must not leave
                    this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody.
                    Anything you do could have serious reprocautions on
                    future events. Do you understand? Of course I do. Just
                    a second, let's see if I could find it. He's fine,
                    and he's completely unaware that anything happened.
                    As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous.
                    That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind
                    mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive
                    at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how
                    it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This
                    readout tell you where you're going, this one tells
                    you where you are, this one tells you where you were.
                    You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say,
                    you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence,
                    or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter
                    date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes,
                    of course, November 5, 1955.</p>
                <h4 class="heading">Heading Four</h4>
                <p>Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin
                    Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough,
                    I'll need your assistance. Oh, just a little weather
                    experiment. Never mind that now, never mind that now.
                    And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. No, I
                    refuse to except the responsibility.</p>

                    you've come from a great distance? Alright kid, you
                    stick to your father like glue and make sure that he
                    takes her to the dance. So tell me, future boy, who's
                    president of the United States in 1985? Why that's
                    me, look at me, I'm an old man. Erased from existence.
